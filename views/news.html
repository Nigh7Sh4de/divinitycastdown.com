                    We are heading into the studio and are nearly ready to unleash some technical and intense metal on the world. Then we will hit the stage in the very near future to bring our music to the masses live in person.

                    Divinity Cast Down welcomes another new member, Dennis Plotnik on guitar and backup vocals. Young and eager to learn, Dennis has picked up all the songs we currently have written, as well as added in his own lead lines to complete them. With him the lineup is now complete and we are excited to finally rehearse as a full band.

                    It is official. Divinity Cast Down welcomes Marius Necula to the fold as our new bassist. Talented and ambitious, Marius has been learning our originals for the past few weeks and adding his own flair to the sound. We are psyched to have him join us and the band is now nearly complete. We just need another guitarist; someone equally dedicated to our metal vision.

                    A touch of death, a dash of thrash, some blackened melodies with a vulgar rasp. Aggressive and dark, Divinity Cast Down is a metal band. Period.
